          <p>Your language is <strong>C#</strong>!. This language is a modern, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft and approved by European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) and International Standards Organization (ISO). C# was developed by Anders Hejlsberg and his team during the development of .Net Framework.<a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/csharp/csharp_overview.htm" target="_blank">(1)</a></p>
            
          <p>The following reasons make C# a widely used professional language:
          <ol>
            <li>It is a modern, general-purpose programming language</li>
            <li>It is object oriented.</li>
            <li>It is component oriented.</li>
            <li>It is easy to learn.</li>
            <li>It is a structured language.</li>
            <li>It produces efficient programs.</li>
            <li>It can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms.</li>
            <li>It is a part of .Net Framework.</li>

          <p>Your language is <strong>Ruby</strong>!, This language is just for you, its a balance between elegant & straightforward and you for sure fit in this category. Ruby is a scripting language built from the ground up for use in front end and back end web development and similar applications. It is a robust, dynamically typed, and object-oriented language. What’s more, its syntax is so high-level and easy to understand that it’s considered as close as you can get to coding in English. 
          More than one person has commented that they could basically understand Ruby code even without knowing how to program! <a href="https://careerkarma.com/blog/what-is-ruby-used-for/" target="_blank">(2)</a></p>

          <p>Released in the 1990s, Ruby is an open-sourced language created by the Japanese programmer Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto. He has stated that the language is designed to be both fun and productive. Ruby is scripted, meaning that it’s an interpreted language rather than a compiled one.</p><a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/about/" target="_black">More info!</a>

        <div id="python">
          <p>Your language is <strong>Phyton</strong>!, Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.</p> <a href="https://www.python.org/about/">More info!</a>

        <div id="javaScript">
          <p>Your language is <strong>JavaScript</strong>!.JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.
          The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads.
          Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need special preparation or compilation to run.
          In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language called Java.</p>
          <h5>Why is it called JavaScript?</h5>
          <p>When JavaScript was created, it initially had another name: “LiveScript”. But Java was very popular at that time, so it was decided that positioning a new language as a “younger brother” of Java would help.
          But as it evolved, JavaScript became a fully independent language with its own specification called ECMAScript, and now it has no relation to Java at all.</p> <a href="https://javascript.info/intro">More info!</a>
